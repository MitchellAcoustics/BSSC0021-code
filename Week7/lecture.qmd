## Focus: Unified Statistical Thinking

- Moving beyond isolated statistical techniques
- Seeing connections between t-tests, ANOVA, and regression
- Understanding the common mathematical framework
- Simplifying the interpretation of statistical models

::: {.notes}
This lecture introduces the concept of the general linear model as a unifying framework for various statistical techniques. By understanding this framework, students will gain a deeper appreciation for how different statistical tests are related to each other.

Key points to emphasize:

- The power of seeing statistics through a unified lens
- How this approach simplifies understanding and application
- The practical benefits of this perspective when working with real data
