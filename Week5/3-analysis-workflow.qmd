## The process of statistical modeling

There is a set of steps that we generally go through when we want to use our statistical model to test a scientific hypothesis:

1. Specify your question of interest
2. Identify or collect the appropriate data
3. Prepare the data for analysis
4. Determine the appropriate model
5. Fit the model to the data
6. Criticize the model to make sure it fits properly
7. Test hypothesis and quantify effect size
8. Communicate your analysis

## Data Analysis Workflow

## Import

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Throughout, we have been using the `tidyverse` library of packages for data analysis. 

The tidyverse is an opinionated **collection of R packages** designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

::: {.column width="50%"}

## Import 

- There are tools for reading data from almost any source:
  - `read_csv()`, `read_excel()`, `read_rds()`, ...
- When we load a dataset with a `tidyverse()` function, it will return a `tibble`

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data <- read_csv("data/Apple_Emissions/greenhouse_gas_emissions.csv")
```

## Tidy

The same data can be represented in multiple ways. Here's the same data organized three different ways:

::: notes
Each dataset shows the same values of four variables: country, year, population, and number of documented cases of TB (tuberculosis), but each dataset organizes the values in a different way.
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
table1
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
table3
```

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r, echo=TRUE}
table2
```

- There are three rules that make a dataset tidy:
  1. Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.
  2. Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.
  3. Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.

### Why ensure your data is tidy?

1. There’s a general advantage to picking one consistent way of storing data. If you have a consistent data structure, it’s easier to learn the tools that work with it because they have an underlying uniformity.
2. There’s a specific advantage to placing variables in columns because it allows R’s vectorized nature to shine. That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural.

So, our first task after importing the data is to make sure it's tidy. In addition to the rules above, this can also include things like:

- ensure the data types are correct
- clean up the column names
- make sure we know what the variables represent

For the .csv data we loaded, our column names can be a bit difficult to work with since they have spaces in them. We can use a function from the `janitor` package to clean these:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data <- data |>
  janitor::clean_names()
data
```

## Transform

We've dealt with data transformations quite a bit already. This includes operations like calculating the mean for different groups, or for multiple groups:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data |>
  group_by(category) |>
  summarise(
    mean_emissions = mean(emissions, na.rm = TRUE),
  )
```

## Visualize

```{r, echo=TRUE}
data |>
  group_by(category, fiscal_year) |>
  summarise(emissions = sum(emissions, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = fiscal_year, y = emissions, color = category)) +
  geom_line()
```

## Communicate

This is where we will dive into using Quarto. Start by downloading the Apple Emissions dataset from Moodle and open RStudio. 

We'll go through how to create and write a full analysis in a `.qmd` file using this dataset.

Refer to our [lecture notes specifically on using Quarto](https://drandrewmitchell.com/BSSC0021-code/Week5/sampling-exercise-walkthrough.html)
