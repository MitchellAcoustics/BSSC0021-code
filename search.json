Let’s incorporate species into our plot and see if this reveals any additional insights into the apparent relationship between these variables. We will do this by representing species with different colored points.\nTo achieve this, will we need to modify the aesthetic or the geom? If you guessed “in the aesthetic mapping, inside of aes()”, you’re already getting the hang of creating data visualizations with ggplot2! And if not, don’t worry.\nAdd color = species to the aesthetic mapping. This tells ggplot2 to color the points by species.\nWhen we map a categorical variable to an aesthetic, ggplot2 automatically: - Assigns a unique value to each level (here, a unique color for each species) - Adds a legend explaining the mapping"

If you haven’t already, install it with:\ndevtools::install_github(\"antoinevernet/DataAnalytics\")\nThen run:\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\"02-Visualisation\", package = \"DataAnalytics\")\nThis interactive tutorial will help reinforce the concepts we cover in class.\nYou are also encouraged to do additional practice by completing the Data Visualization exercise from R for Data Science. This tutorial package can be installed and run the same way as DataAnalytics:\ninstall.packages(\"r4ds.tutorial\")\nlearnr::run_tutorial(\"01-data-visualization\", package = \"r4ds.tutorial\")\nLooking forward to exploring data visualization with you!"
