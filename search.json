With ggplot2, you can do more and faster by learning one system and applying it in many places.\nThis presentation is based on the Data Visualization chapter of the R for Data Science book by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund."

Nonlinear?\nDoes the relationship vary by the species of the penguin? How about by the island where the penguin lives?"

The mapping argument of the ggplot() function defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties (aesthetics) of your plot.\n\nThe mapping argument is always defined in the aes() function, and the x and y arguments of aes() specify which variables to map to the x and y axes.\n\nFor now, we will only map flipper length to the x aesthetic and body mass to the y aesthetic. ggplot2 looks for the mapped variables in the data argument, in this case, penguins."

The plot displays a positive, linear, and relative strong relationship between these two variables.\nBefore we add more layers to this plot, let’s pause for a moment and review the warning message we got:\nWe’re seeing this message because there are two penguins in our dataset with missing body mass and/or flipper length values and ggplot2 has no way of representing them on the plot without both of these values. Like R, ggplot2 subscribes to the philosophy that missing values should never silently go missing. This type of warning is probably one of the most common types of warnings you will see when working with real data – missing values are a very common issue and you’ll learn more about them throughout the book, particularly in ?@sec-missing-values. For the remaining plots in this chapter we will suppress this warning so it’s not printed alongside every single plot we make."
