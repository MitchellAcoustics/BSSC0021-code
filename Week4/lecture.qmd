## Overview

- Three major goals of statistics:
 - Describe
 - Decide
 - Predict

## Focus: Statistical Decision Making

- Using statistics to make decisions about hypotheses
- Specifically: Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing (NHST)
- Essential for understanding research results
- Important to understand both uses and limitations

## What We'll Cover

- Introduction to NHST
- Steps in hypothesis testing
- Test statistics and distributions
- P-values and their interpretation
- Statistical significance

::: {.notes}
This chapter introduces the concepts behind using statistics to make decisions -- specifically, decisions about whether particular hypotheses are supported by data.

Key points to emphasize:

- NHST is widely used but has limitations
- Understanding both uses and criticisms is essential
- Focus on practical application and interpretation

## Using Statistics to make decisions {.incremental}

Today, we'll discuss the use of statistics to make decisions -- in particular, decisions about whether a particular hypothesis is supported by the data. There are three major goals of statistics:

-   Describe
-   Decide
-   Predict

We'll cover:

1.  **Statistical inference** - Using a sample to generalize (or infer) about the population.
2.  **Sampling distributions and standard error** - What does it actually mean to analyse a sample?
3.  **Confidence interval** - How certain are we about our estimate?
4.  **Hypothesis Testing** - How do we use data to answer a hypothesis and make a decision?

## Learning Objectives

:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: incremental
-   Understand point estimation
-   Apply and interpret the Central Limit Theorem
-   Construct and interpret confidence intervals for means
-   Understand the behaviour of confidence intervals
-   Carry out hypothesis tests for means (t-test)
-   Understand the probabilities of error in hypypothesis tests

## Further Reading

There are several more topics to understand about p-values which we cannot cover today:
- One-sided vs Two-sided t-test.
  - Are we testing "there is no difference" or are we testing "$mean_A > mean_B$?
- Type I and Type II Errors
  - False positive vs False negative
- Multiple Comparisons
  - What happens to $P(data|H_0$) when we run multiple tests on the same data?
  - How do we control the error rate across our entire *family* of tests?

::: fragment
There are also numerous modern critiques of p-values and how they are used and interpreted.

See *Statistical Thinking* Chapter 9 for a detailed discussion.
