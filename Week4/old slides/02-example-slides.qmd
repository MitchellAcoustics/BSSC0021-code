## Real World Example: Police Body Cameras {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### The Study

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**Research Question:**

Do body-worn cameras reduce use of force by police officers?

**Washington DC Study (2015/2016):**

- Large-scale randomized controlled trial
- Officers randomly assigned to groups:
  * Treatment: Wear body camera
  * Control: No body camera
- Tracked multiple outcomes:
  * Use of force incidents
  * Civilian complaints
  * Officer behavior

**Perfect for Learning NHST:**

1. Clear research question
2. Well-defined groups
3. Measurable outcomes
4. Real-world importance

Key points about the body cameras study:

1. Background:
   - Growing interest in police accountability
   - Body cameras seen as potential solution
   - Need rigorous evidence for policy decisions
   - Large-scale implementation costs

2. Study Design:
   - Randomized controlled trial is gold standard
   - Random assignment prevents selection bias
   - Control group essential for comparison
   - Multiple outcomes provide comprehensive view

3. Why it's a good teaching example:
   - Clear hypothesis to test
   - Intuitive expectations
   - Well-defined measures
   - Important real-world implications
   - Shows scientific approach to policy

## Intuition vs Reality {.smaller}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### What We Want

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
**Our Natural Approach:**

1. Collect the data
2. Compare groups
3. Calculate probability cameras work
4. Make direct conclusion

**Seems Logical:**

- Direct answer to our question
- Clear probability statement
- Straightforward decision
- Intuitive process
::::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r intuitive-approach}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4
#| echo: false

# Create visualization of intuitive approach
set.seed(123)
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 100)
null_dist <- dnorm(x)
alt_dist <- dnorm(x, mean = 1)

df <- data.frame(
  x = rep(x, 2),
  y = c(null_dist, alt_dist),
  Distribution = rep(c("No Effect", "Cameras Work"), each = 100)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y, color = Distribution)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "What We Want: Direct Evidence",
       subtitle = "Compare probabilities of each hypothesis",
       x = "Effect of Body Cameras on Use of Force",
       y = "Probability",
       color = "Hypothesis") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

### What NHST Does

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
**The NHST Approach:**

1. Assume "no effect" is true
2. Calculate probability of our data
3. Reject null if data very unlikely
4. Never prove alternative true

**Counter-Intuitive:**

- Indirect evidence
- Assumes null true
- Can only reject null
- Probability of data, not hypothesis
::::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r nhst-approach}
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-height: 4
#| echo: false

# Create visualization of NHST approach
x <- seq(-4, 4, length.out = 100)
y <- dnorm(x)
crit_value <- qnorm(0.975)
df <- data.frame(
  x = x,
  y = y,
  region = ifelse(abs(x) >= crit_value, "Critical", "Non-critical")
)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = region)) +
  geom_area(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-crit_value, crit_value), 
             linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "What NHST Does: Test Against Null",
       subtitle = "Reject null if data falls in critical regions",
       x = "Observed Difference in Use of Force",
       y = "Probability if No Effect",
       caption = "Red lines show typical significance threshold") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Critical" = "red", "Non-critical" = "blue")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

### Key Differences

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Intuitive Approach:**

- ✓ Direct probability of hypothesis
- ✓ Clear interpretation
- ✓ Matches how we think
- ✗ Not possible in practice
- ✗ Requires prior probabilities
::::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**NHST Approach:**

- ✓ Works with available data
- ✓ Controls error rates
- ✓ No prior probabilities needed
- ✗ Indirect evidence
- ✗ Often misinterpreted

::: {.notes}
Key points about intuition vs NHST:

1. Our Natural Intuition:
   - Want direct probability of hypothesis
   - Think in terms of proving ideas
   - Expect clear yes/no answers
   - Prefer straightforward interpretation

2. NHST Reality:
   - Can only test against null
   - Never proves alternative true
   - Provides indirect evidence
   - Controls long-run error rates

3. Why the Difference:
   - Can't calculate P(hypothesis|data) directly
   - Need Bayesian approach for that
   - NHST gives P(data|hypothesis)
   - Practical but counter-intuitive

4. Important Implications:
   - Must understand both approaches
   - Recognize NHST limitations
   - Avoid common misinterpretations
   - Consider multiple types of evidence

**Next Steps:**

1. Learn the Six Steps
   - Formulate hypothesis
   - Specify null/alternative
   - Collect data
   - Compute test statistic

**Key Points to Remember:**

- NHST is counter-intuitive
- Focus on evidence against null
- Never proves hypotheses true
- Controls error rates
- Requires careful interpretation
