   - Key limitations and criticisms

2. [Body Cameras Example and NHST Process](02-example-slides.html)
   - Real-world police body camera study
   - Intuitive vs actual hypothesis testing
   - Why NHST seems counter-intuitive
   - Importance of proper study design

3. [Steps of Hypothesis Testing](03-steps-slides.html)
   - Complete six-step NHST process
   - Detailed BMI and physical activity example
   - Practical implementation guide
   - Common pitfalls to avoid
   
4. [Deep Dive into Test Statistics](04-test-statistic-slides.html)
   - Historical development (Student's t)
   - Different types of test statistics
   - Understanding distributions
   - Modern alternatives

5. [Deep Dive into p-values](05-pvalues-slides.html)
   - Historical perspectives
   - Modern simulation methods
   - Recent controversies
   - Future directions

6. [Modern Challenges in Statistical Significance](06-significance-slides.html)
   - Reproducibility crisis
   - Big data challenges
   - Power and sample size
   - Future of statistical testing

## Learning Objectives

After this lecture, you should be able to:

- Identify the components of a hypothesis test, including the parameter of interest, the null and alternative hypotheses, and the test statistic
- Describe the proper interpretations of a p-value as well as common misinterpretations
- Distinguish between the two types of error in hypothesis testing, and the factors that determine them
- Describe how resampling can be used to compute a p-value
- Describe the problem of multiple testing, and how it can be addressed
- Describe the main criticisms of null hypothesis statistical testing
