## Overview

- Three major goals of statistics:
 - Describe
 - Decide
 - Predict

## Focus: Statistical Decision Making

- Using statistics to make decisions about hypotheses
- Specifically: Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing (NHST)
- Essential for understanding research results
- Important to understand both uses and limitations

## What We'll Cover

- Introduction to NHST
- Steps in hypothesis testing
- Test statistics and distributions
- P-values and their interpretation
- Statistical significance

::: {.notes}
This chapter introduces the concepts behind using statistics to make decisions -- specifically, decisions about whether particular hypotheses are supported by data.

Key points to emphasize:
- NHST is widely used but has limitations
- Understanding both uses and criticisms is essential
- Focus on practical application and interpretation
