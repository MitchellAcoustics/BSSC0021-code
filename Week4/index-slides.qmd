This week's lecture is divided into six parts:

1. [Introduction and Background](01-intro-slides.html)
   - Three goals of statistics
   - Introduction to NHST
   - Connection to sampling concepts

2. [Body Cameras Example and NHST Process](02-example-slides.html)
   - Real-world example with body cameras
   - Counter-intuitive nature of NHST
   - Overview of six-step process

3. [Steps of Hypothesis Testing](03-steps-slides.html)
   - Formulating hypotheses
   - Specifying null and alternative
   - Data collection
   
4. [Test Statistics and the t-Distribution](04-test-statistic-slides.html)
   - Understanding test statistics
   - The t-distribution
   - Welch's t-test

5. [Computing p-values](05-pvalues-slides.html)
   - Theoretical approach
   - Simulation approach
   - One-tailed vs two-tailed tests

6. [Statistical Significance and Multiple Testing](06-significance-slides.html)
   - Assessing significance
   - Statistical vs practical significance
   - Multiple testing problem
   - Common misinterpretations

## Learning Objectives

After this lecture, you should be able to:

- Identify the components of a hypothesis test, including the parameter of interest, the null and alternative hypotheses, and the test statistic
- Describe the proper interpretations of a p-value as well as common misinterpretations
- Distinguish between the two types of error in hypothesis testing, and the factors that determine them
- Describe how resampling can be used to compute a p-value
- Describe the problem of multiple testing, and how it can be addressed
- Describe the main criticisms of null hypothesis statistical testing
