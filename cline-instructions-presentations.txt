## 1.

Write a detailed summary of the content and key concepts presented in @/Week3/poldrack-probability.Rmd

## 2. 

Create a plan for turning@/Week3/poldrack-probability.Rmd into a quarto revealjs presentation for a statistics class lecture. Target a length of about 20 minutes. Focus on: (1) Making sure the key takeaway concepts are highlighted and written on the slides with enough detail to be comprehensible on their own, (2) reproducing the examples, demonstrations, and visualisations used, and (3) Including any other content from the chapter in the speakers notes (this is not actually for the speaker necessarily, but for keeping all of the information together). Think of this task more as a reformatting exercise than a summary exercise. We want the same info and mostly the same depth of information, but in a presentation format. Do not skip any part of the original notes.

## 3. 

As you go, also suggest places to include figures or, if necessary, incorporate new code-generated outputs. Ignore R errors for now. The content is the important thing. Please proceed with implementing the plan.
